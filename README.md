CraftVersion is an implementation of git for the common task of managing `/plugins/*/*.yml` configurations. As you may be aware, this becomes quite a challenge whenever there's more than one person modifying server configurations.

**This is a beta plugin** which only purpose is to provide server administrators a utility to have better control for the configurations while enabling faster rollbacks and configuration versioning.
